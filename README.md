# roman-to-int
use hashmap and pay attention to cross-border issues

In C++ class I have leared the STL Containers, but I don't think I am proficient in STL.As expected, the convenience and importance of STL show up in this code.Besides, from the comment of other coders I've got a new tip that if "i<s.length()" will be uesd with "i++" in the filed of "if-else", please correct it as "i<s.length()-1" to avoid the cross-border issues.
